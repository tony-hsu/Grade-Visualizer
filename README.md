# Grades Visualizer

The purpose of this project is to explore a data set containing raw scores of ficitious students in a hypothetical course. It will involve Shiny app to visualize the result as well as functions that constructed the app.


- Special instructions for any user (if necessary)
- Special instructions for graders (if necessary)
- Links to any resources that you used to complete the HW
I referenced this website (http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf) to get colors.
- List of references that you used to complete the HW

This is not my first time writing unit tests. I found the
logic of testthat tests to be a 8 in terms of confusing.
This is my first time working with ggvis. I would give a 8 in terms
of finding the syntax of ggvis to be confusing. This was not the
first time working with conditional panels in shiny.
I find it to be a 8 in terms of working with conditional panels.
I like ggvis the most because I use the concepts I learned in base plots
and ggplot to work with ggvis. No one helped me completing the assignment.
It took about 12 hours to complete the HW. The most time consuming part
was working with Shin
